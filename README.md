# About Me

Hello! I'm Alex, a dedicated cybersecurity professional I will be focusing on network mapping and monitoring in this project. I have used Zenmap and wireshark in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and threats within network environments using these industry-standard toolsk. My hands-on experience and continuous learning in the field enable me to stay ahead of emerging threats and implement effective security measures.

## Competencies

### Network Mapping and Monitoring

**4042.5.3 : Mapping and Monitoring**

I excel at executing network mapping and monitoring procedures to uncover vulnerabilities and anomalies within networks. My skills include:

- **Network Mapping with Nmap:** I proficiently use Nmap to analyze network topologies, identify active devices, and detect potential vulnerabilities. By running comprehensive scans, I gather detailed information about the network structure and pinpoint areas that require security enhancements.
  
- **Network Monitoring with Wireshark:** I employ Wireshark to monitor network traffic, capture packets, and identify anomalies. My expertise allows me to analyze captured data, detect suspicious activities, and understand their potential implications on network security.

## Key Projects

### Network Vulnerability Assessment

This project served as a comprehensive assessment of my competency with Nmap and Wireshark, essential tools in the cybersecurity field. I conducted a thorough assessment of a virtual network, which included the following tasks:

- **Nmap Analysis:** 
  - Described the network topology discovered using Nmap, providing visual evidence through screenshots. This demonstrated my ability to map network structures accurately and identify active devices.
  
- **Vulnerability Summary:**
  - Summarized the vulnerabilities detected by Nmap scans and their potential impact on the network. This highlighted my skill in interpreting scan results and understanding their security implications.
  
- **Wireshark Anomalies:**
  - Documented anomalies found in network traffic captured with Wireshark, including evidence of the range of affected packets. This showcased my proficiency in monitoring network traffic and detecting irregularities.
  
- **Implications and Recommendations:**
  - Discussed the potential consequences of not addressing the identified issues and proposed actionable solutions supported by reliable industry research. This illustrated my ability to provide informed recommendations to enhance network security.

## Continuous Learning

In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, staying updated with the latest tools and techniques is crucial. I am committed to continuous learning and regularly participate in professional development activities to enhance my skills and knowledge.
